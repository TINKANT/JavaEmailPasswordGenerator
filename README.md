This project uses the terminal to receive input from the SysAdmin in charge of generating e-mails for new hires of a company. 
The SysAdmin is asked for the first and last name of the hired personnel, along with selecting one of 6 departments with an option to include none.
The program generates a random password with a length of 12 characters (lowercase/uppercase Latin alphabet + !#@$), and an e-mail that follows the syntax of "firstnamelastname@department.companyname.com".
Currently, mailbox capacity is pre-determined in "Email.java" and can not be edited from this app without touching the code.
